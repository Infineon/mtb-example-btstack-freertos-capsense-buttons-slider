# Bluetooth&reg; LE with CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider

This code example features a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server with a 5-segment linear slider and two CAPSENSE&trade; buttons. Button 0 turns the LED ON, Button 1 turns the LED OFF, and the slider controls the brightness of the LED. The button status and slider data are sent to the GATT Client over GATT notification. This project uses the CAPSENSE&trade; middleware library; it is developed in the ModusToolbox&trade; software environment.

This code example uses FreeRTOS. Visit the [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org) website for documentation and API references.

      **Figure 4. CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner showing touch data**

      ![](images/tuner_display.png)

      The CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner can also be used for tuning CAPSENSE&trade; parameters and measuring signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). See the [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTuner) (**Help** > **View Help**) and [AN85951 – PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on selecting the tuning parameters.


## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging for PSOC&trade; 6 MCU)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>


## Design and implementation

The Bluetooth&reg; LE CAPSENSE&trade; Buttons and Slider is a Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server where the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider data is stored and notified to the client; it scans a self-capacitance (CSD) based, 5-element CAPSENSE&trade; slider and two mutual capacitance (CSX) CAPSENSE&trade; buttons for user input.

See [AN85951 – PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

In this application, the state of the user LED is controlled based on user inputs provided using the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider. A PWM HAL resource is configured for controlling the brightness of the LED. Touching Button 0 turn the LED ON and Button 1 turn the LED OFF. The brightness of the LED is set based on the touch position on the CAPSENSE&trade; slider.

The [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) provides step-by-step instructions on how to configure CAPSENSE&trade; in the application. The CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator and Tuner tools can be launched from the CSD personality in the Device Configurator tool.

The application uses an [EZI2C HAL](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-hal-cat1/html/group__group__hal__ezi2c.html) interface for communicating with the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner.

The firmware uses FreeRTOS to execute the tasks required by this application. The following tasks are created:

1. **CAPSENSE&trade; task:** Initializes the CAPSENSE&trade; hardware block, processes the touch input, and sends a command to the LED task to update the LED status.

2. **Board task:** Initializes the TCPWM in PWM mode for driving the LED and updates the status of the LED based on the received command.

3. **Bluetooth&reg; LE task:** Initializes the Bluetooth&reg; stack and GATT services, and sends the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider values to the client via notifications.

A FreeRTOS-based timer is used for making the CAPSENSE&trade; scan periodic; a queue is used for communication between the CAPSENSE&trade; task and LED task. *FreeRTOSConfig.h* contains the FreeRTOS settings and configurations.

**Figure 5. CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider implementation**

### Operation at custom power supply voltages

The application is configured to work with the default operating voltage of the kit.

**Table 1. Operating voltages supported by the kits**

Kit                   | Supported operating voltages | Default operating voltage
:-------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------
CY8CPROTO-062-4343W   | 3.3 V/1.8 V                  | 3.3 V                     
CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT   | 3.3 V/1.8 V                  | 3.3 V                     
CY8CKIT-062S2-43012   | 3.3 V/1.8 V                  | 3.3 V                     
CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01 | 3.3 V only                   | 3.3 V                     
CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01 | 1.8 V only                   | 1.8 V                     
CY8CKIT-062-BLE       | 3.3 V/1.8 V                  | 3.3 V                     

<br>

For kits that support multiple operating voltages, the default BSP configuration provided by the *design.modus* file should be customized. Do the following to use the example at a custom power supply, such as 1.8 V:

1. Create a directory at the root of the application to hold any custom BSP configuration files: *\<application_folder>/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS*.

2. Create a subdirectory for each target that needs to be modified to work at a custom power supply: *\<application_folder>/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>*.

3. Copy the *design.modus* file and other configuration files (from the *../mtb_shared/TARGET_\<kit>/{version}/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS*) directory and paste them into the new directory for the target.

4. In the application's Makefile, update the following lines:
   ```
   DISABLE_COMPONENTS += BSP_DESIGN_MODUS
   COMPONENTS += CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS
   ```
5. Launch the [Device Configurator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig) tool using the Quick Panel link in the IDE. This opens the *design.modus* file from the newly created *COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<kit>* folder; you are now free to customize the configuration as required.

6. Update the **Operating Conditions** parameters in **Power Settings** with the desired voltage and select **File** > **Save**.

   **Figure 6. Power settings to work with 1.8 V**

   ![](images/figure4.png)

7. Change the jumper/switch setting as follows:

   **Table 2. Jumper/switch position for 1.8 V operation**

   Kit                    | Jumper/switch position 
   :----------------------| ---------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062-4343W    | J3 (1-2)               
   CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT    | SW5 (1-2)              
   CY8CKIT-062S2-43012    | J14 (1-2)              
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W  | J3 (1-2)               
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W  | SW5 (1-2)              

<br>

8. Re-build and program the application to evaluate the application at the new power setting.


### Resources and settings

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the device configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator which generate the configuration firmware. This file is stored in the respective kit BSP folder in *mtb_shared* project. For example, for CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 the path is *<workspace_path>mtb_shared\TARGET_CY8CKIT-062S2-43012\latest-v3.X\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/design.modus*. See the [Device configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*. Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. As explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section, the only extra service added is the Immediate Alert Service (IAS). See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).
